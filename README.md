A Word on Branches
m-Posyandu is, like any Github project, a constant work-in-progress. This means that you will, if you look, notice there are other branches. We recommend that all developers who are new to Applicasa and just getting their feet wet with the SDK and frameworks stick to the stable branch only. The master branch is our main development branch, and all other branches are feature-specific branches that are currently under development and will be merged into stable when they are tested and ready. You may check out these branches at any time if you want to see other feature work and examples of how to implement those in your game (where applicable), but be aware that we don't support any branches other than stable at this time (for issues and whatnot).


### Build Configuration
